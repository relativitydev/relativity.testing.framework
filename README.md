# Relativity.Testing.Framework

:+1::tada: Welcome to Relativity.Testing.Framework! :tada::+1:

The [Relativity.Testing.Framework](https://github.com/relativitydev/relativity.testing.framework) and [Relativity.Testing.Framework.Api](https://github.com/relativitydev/relativity.testing.framework.api) are repositories that comprise Relativity.Testing.Framework.

At a high level, Relativity.Testing.Framework handles configuration management and object models, while Relativity.Testing.Framework.Api handles the interactions with the Relativity APIs.

This repository contains a C#/NuGet library that abstracts out common functionality for test setup and teardown.

## Supported Relativity Versions

The Relativity Testing Framework repository for RelativityOne will no longer be available publicly beginning **2024/05/31**.Â  Developers are recommended to move towards using the Relativity APIs directly. See post from Community Site [here](https://community.relativity.com/s/feed/0D5Qi0000087STIKA2).

Relativity Testing Framework will **continue to be supported for Relativity Server development**. Effective with the Server 2023 release you can find the latest Relativity Testing Framework SDK package on the **Server SDK package feed [here](https://relativitypackageseastus.jfrog.io/ui/native/server-nuget-remote/)**. For more information on the Server SDK feed and go-forward Server SDK strategy please see [here](https://platform.relativity.com/Server2023/Content/What_s_new/Server_SDK_Changes.htm).

## Reporting Issues and Adding Feature Enhancements

For bug reports or feature enhancements, please create an [Issue](https://github.com/relativitydev/relativity.testing.framework/issues) using the respective template. Before reporting an issue, please follow these guidelines. It helps us in understanding the request and provide a quicker response time.

- Determine if it's a bug report or a feature enhancement.
- Perform a quick search in the [issue tracker](https://github.com/relativitydev/relativity.testing.framework/issues) to see if the issue has already been reported. If it has, add a comment to the existing issue instead of opening a new one.
- If you find a **Closed** issue that seems like it is the same thing that you're experiencing, open a new issue and include a link to the original issue in the body of your new one.

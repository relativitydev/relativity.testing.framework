               Did the problem start happening recently (e.g. after updating to a new version of Relativity.Testing.Framework) or was this always a problem?
               If the problem started happening recently, can you reproduce the problem in an older version of Relativity.Testing.Framework? 
               What's the most recent version in which the problem doesn't happen?
               Can you reliably reproduce the issue? If not, provide details about how often the problem happens and under which conditions it normally happens.
